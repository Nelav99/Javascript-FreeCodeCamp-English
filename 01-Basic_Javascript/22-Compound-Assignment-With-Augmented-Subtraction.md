# Description:

Like the `+=` operator, `-=` subtracts a number from a variable.


```Js
myVar = myVar - 5;
```

will subtract `5` from `myVar`. This can be rewritten as:

```Js
myVar -= 5;
```

# Instructions:

Convert the assignments for `a`, `b`, and `c` to use the `-=` operator.

# Code To Solve:

```Js
let a = 11;
let b = 9;
let c = 3;

// Only change code below this line
a = a - 6;
b = b - 15;
c = c - 1;
```

# Solution:

```Js
let a = 11;
let b = 9;
let c = 3;

// Only change code below this line
a -= 6;
b -= 15;
c -= 1;
```
