# Description:

Create a shopping list in the variable `myList`. The list should be a multi-dimensional array containing several sub-arrays.

The first element in each sub-array should contain a string with the name of the item. The second element should be a number representing the quantity i.e.

```Js
["Chocolate Bar", 15]
```

There should be at least 5 sub-arrays in the list.

# Code To Solve:

```Js
const myList = [];
```

# Solution:

```Js
const myList = [['apple', 6], ['pineapple', 1], ['peach', 4], ['strawberrys', 5], ['banana', 3]];
```
