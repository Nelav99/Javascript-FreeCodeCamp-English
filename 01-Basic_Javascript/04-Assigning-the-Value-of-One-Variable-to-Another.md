# Description:

After a value is assigned to a variable using the <dfn>assignment</dfn> operator, you can assign the value of that variable to another variable using the <dfn>assignment</dfn> operator.

```js
var myVar;
myVar = 5;
var myNum;
myNum = myVar;
```

The above declares a `myVar` variable with no value, then assigns it the value `5`. Next, a variable named `myNum` is declared with no value. Then, the contents of `myVar` (which is `5`) is assigned to the variable `myNum`. Now, `myNum` also has the value of `5`.

# Instructions:

Assign the contents of `a` to variable `b`.

# Solutions:

```js
var a;
a = 7;
var b;
b = a;
```
