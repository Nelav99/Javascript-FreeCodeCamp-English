# Description:

We can also subtract one number from another.

JavaScript uses the `-` symbol for subtraction.

**Example**

```js
const myVar = 12 - 6;
```

`myVar` would have the value `6`.

# Instructions:

Change the `0` so the difference is `12`.

# Code To Solve:

```js
const difference = 45 - 0;
```

# Solution:

```js
const difference = 45 - 33;
```
