# Description:

We can also divide one number by another.

JavaScript uses the `/` symbol for division.

**Example**

```js
const myVar = 16 / 2;
```

`myVar` now has the value `8`.

# Instructions:

Change the `0` so that the `quotient` is equal to `2`.

# Code To Solve:

```js
const quotient = 66 / 0;
```

# Solution:

```js
const quotient = 66 / 33;
```
