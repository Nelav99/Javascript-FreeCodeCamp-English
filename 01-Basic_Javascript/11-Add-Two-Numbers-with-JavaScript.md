# Description:

`Number` is a data type in JavaScript which represents numeric data.

Now let's try to add two numbers using JavaScript.

JavaScript uses the `+` symbol as an addition operator when placed between two numbers.

**Example:**

```js
const myVar = 5 + 10;
```

`myVar` now has the value `15`.

# Instructions:

Change the `0` so that sum will equal `20`.

# Code To Solve:

```js
const sum = 10 + 0;
```

# Solution:

```js
const sum = 10 + 10;
```
