# Description:

Sometimes you will need to build a string. By using the concatenation operator (`+`), you can insert one or more variables into a string you're building.

Example:

```Js
const ourName = "freeCodeCamp";
const ourStr = "Hello, our name is " + ourName + ", how are you?";
```

`ourStr` would have a value of the string `Hello, our name is freeCodeCamp, how are you?`.

# Instructions:

Set `myName` to a string equal to your name and build `myStr` with `myName` between the strings `My name is` and `and I am well!`

# Code To Solve:

```Js
// Only change code below this line
const myName = "";
const myStr = "";
```

# Solution:

```Js
// Only change code below this line
const myName = "Valent√≠n";
const myStr = "My name is " + myName + " and I am well!";
```
