# Description:

You can easily <dfn>increment</dfn> or add one to a variable with the `++` operator.

```js
i++;
```

is the equivalent of

```js
i = i + 1;
```

**Note:** The entire line becomes `i++;`, eliminating the need for the equal sign.

# Instructions:

Change the code to use the `++` operator on `myVar`.

# Code To Solve:

```js
let myVar = 87;

// Only change code below this line
myVar = myVar + 1;
```

# Solution:

```js
let myVar = 87;
myVar++;
```
