# Description:

In JavaScript all variables and function names are case sensitive. This means that capitalization matters.

`MYVAR` is not the same as `MyVar` nor `myvar`. It is possible to have multiple distinct variables with the same name but different casing. It is strongly recommended that for the sake of clarity, you *do not* use this language feature.

**Best Practice**

Write variable names in JavaScript in <dfn>camelCase</dfn>. In <dfn>camelCase</dfn>, multi-word variable names have the first word in lowercase and the first letter of each subsequent word is capitalized.

**Examples:**

```js
var someVariable;
var anotherVariableName;
var thisVariableNameIsSoLong;
```

# Instructions:

Modify the existing declarations and assignments so their names use <dfn>camelCase</dfn>.

Do not create any new variables.

# Case To Solve:

```js
// Variable declarations
var StUdLyCapVaR;
var properCamelCase;
var TitleCaseOver;

// Variable assignments
STUDLYCAPVAR = 10;
PRoperCAmelCAse = "A String";
tITLEcASEoVER = 9000;
```

# Solution:

```js
var studlyCapVar;
var properCamelCase;
var titleCaseOver;

studlyCapVar = 10;
properCamelCase = "A String";
titleCaseOver = 9000;
```
