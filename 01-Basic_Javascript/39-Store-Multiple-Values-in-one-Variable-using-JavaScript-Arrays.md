# Description:

With JavaScript `array` variables, we can store several pieces of data in one place.

You start an array declaration with an opening square bracket, end it with a closing square bracket, and put a comma between each entry, like this:

```Js
const sandwich = ["peanut butter", "jelly", "bread"];
```

# Instructions:

Modify the new array `myArray` so that it contains both a string and a number (in that order).

# Code To Solve:

```Js
// Only change code below this line
const myArray = [];
```

# Solution:

```Js
// Only change code below this line
const myArray = ['Pepe', 18];
```
