# Description:

You can also use bracket notation to get the character at other positions within a string.

Remember that computers start counting at `0`, so the first character is actually the zeroth character.

Example:

```Js
const firstName = "Ada";
const secondLetterOfFirstName = firstName[1];
```

`secondLetterOfFirstName` would have a value of the string `d`.

# Instructions:

Let's try to set `thirdLetterOfLastName` to equal the third letter of the `lastName` variable using bracket notation.

**Hint:** Try looking at the example above if you get stuck.

# Code To Solve:

```Js
// Setup
const lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line
const thirdLetterOfLastName = lastName; // Change this line
```

# Solution:

```Js
// Setup
const lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line
const thirdLetterOfLastName = lastName[2]; // Change this line
```
